I am a modern wizard: I speak incantations to computers, who in turn
manifest my will. Well, usually. [Calling up that which I cannot put
down](https://youtu.be/Rrm8usaH0sM?t=162) is a biweekly occurrence.

Less whimsically, I'm a creative, technically-minded
builder-of-things. I enjoy programming, robotics, cooking, writing
fiction, opening hundreds of tabs on Wikipedia, and playing video
games.

Professionally, I'm a software engineer with publications in humanoid
robotics and experience in CLI tooling, data-processing pipelines, and
infrastructure. Not technically "full stack", but I could probably
take a stab at anything from FPGAs to web UIs. [My LinkedIn
profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saul-reynolds-haertle-a9776743/)
has more information.
