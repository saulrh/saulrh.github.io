Savory spinach curry, american style. Just like the restaurant makes
it but vaguely healthy! I make this with tofu, but it should be easy
to change it back to the original paneer.

It's important to use plain yogurt, not greek yogurt; the greek yogurt
is too tangy and will dominate the dish. Also, [a good food
processor](https://smile.amazon.com//dp/B01AXM4WV2) is _absolutely
necessary_; trying to chop the spinach by hand won't get it fine
enough no matter how much chopping you do.

Note that I prefer my saag tofu very spicy. You will probably want to
reduce this by using a less-spicy pepper or processing it to remove
the spicy parts.

No picture yet because I'm still trying to figure out how to plate the
stuff in a vaguely palatable manner.

Start to Eat time: ~1 hour:
- Prep: 15 minutes
- Cook: 35 minutes

## Ingredients

- 12 oz extra-firm tofu
- 1 teaspoon cayenne
- A pinch of salt
- 3 tablespoons oil
- A bit of cornstarch, maybe a teaspoon or two

- 1 pound fresh baby spinach

- 1 large white onion
- 1.5 inch knob of ginger
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 serrano or other small hot pepper

- 1.5 tablespoons oil
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 cup plain yogurt
- A tiny splash of heavy cream, maybe a tablespoon

## Directions

1. Prepare your mise in place:
   1. Cube the tofu into 3/4-inch cubes. Toss with the cayenne, salt,
	  oil, and cornstarch to coat. Set aside while you prep the other
	  ingredients.
   1. Wash the spinach and use the food processor to turn it into a
	  paste. You will have to run it in batches. Transfer it to a bowl
	  and set aside for later.
   1. Quarter the onion and throw it in the food processor. Peel the
	  ginger (scraping it with a spoon works well) and throw it into
	  the food processor. Peel the garlic and throw it into the food
	  processor. Prep the pepper however you like; I just throw it in
	  whole, but this makes the dish very spicy and you'll probably
	  want to cut it open and [scrape out the
	  pith](https://www.cayennediane.com/anatomy-of-a-chile-pepper/). Pulse
	  this mixture until finely chopped, just before it starts turning
	  into a paste.
1. Transfer tofu to a large, cold frying pan. Do not use non-stick;
   you want as much crust as possible. Place on medium-high heat. Wait
   until toasty. Turn. Get as crispy as desired, possibly extremely
   crispy. Pour out onto a plate and set aside.
1. Add oil to pan. Add onion, garlic, ginger, chile mixture. Saute
   until evenly toffee-colored, about 15 minutes. If it starts to dry
   out and burn, add a bit of water.
1. Add spices to the pan. If necessary, add some water so they don't
   burn. Cook, stirring often, to wake up the spices, between two and
   five minutes.
1. Add spinach. Stir well. Add some salt and 1/2 cup water. Cook about
   5 minutes with the lid off.
1. Remove from heat. Add yogurt, a little at a time so it doesn't
   curdle. Add a splash of cream.
1. Return tofu to the mixture and stir. Return to heat. Cover, cook
   until warmed through. Serve.
