These cookies blend sour cream and chocolate to produce a study in
contrasting harmony. The sour cream adds some tang to bring out the
chocolate and offset the sugar, and the water it adds boils away from
the surface to leave behind a crispy cookie shell around a moist,
crumbly interior.

Start to Eat time: ~2.5 hours:
- Mise en place: 1 hour for the butter to come to room temperature.
- Prep: 15 minutes
- Bake: 1.5 hours for 3 batches at 25 minutes per batch
- Rest: None.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
