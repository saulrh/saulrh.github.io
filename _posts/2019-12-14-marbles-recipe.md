A dense, moist chocolate cookie that's neither chewy nor crunchy. The
sour cream adds some tang to bring out the chocolate and offset the
sugar, while the baking powder and flour bring a solid structure to
hold on to the extra liquids.

- Mise en place: 1 hour for the butter to come to room temperature.
- Prep: 15 minutes
- Bake: 1.5 hours for 3 batches at 25 minutes per batch

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
